## **Project Overview**

- The project aims to create an engaging and interactive page that presents the World Happiness Index from 2013 to 2023. Users can explore the data through features highlighting the top 10 happiest and unhappiest countries, alongside a comprehensive table displaying all countries. The page will feature bar and line graphs to clearly illustrate happiness trends over the years, providing a visually appealing experience.
